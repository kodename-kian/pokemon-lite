# Pokemon Lite
**CPSC 210 Term Project**

## About the Project
I owe my interest in Computer Science to video games. 

My first experiences with programming started out because of a desire 
to learn how to make my own video games. From there, one thing led to another,
and now, I'm hoping to pursue Computer Science and software development as a full-time career. 
With that said, it thus felt very fitting that for my personal project in this course, 
I would fulfill my younger self's dreams and create a simple video game. 
With *Pokemon Platinum* on the *3DS* being one of the first games I played as a kid, it 
felt fitting that I go full-circle and choose the Pokemon franchise as my inspiration for this project.

This project is an offline, single-player video game that will aim to recreate some of the
key game mechanics and gameplay loop of the world-renowned Pokemon franchise. The game will be designed
to be playable on desktop, with casual gamers as the target demographic of users in mind. In particular, I hope that I, as well some of my friends, will be able to play
the finished product and find much enjoyment from it.
